# Miscanthus Finance
## Inspiration
Inspiration for this project was partially from requests I have seen of investors requesting a market for expirable futures contracts. The derivatives market is currently valued at $12.4 trillion. Miscanthus aims to bring that market to the blockchain and give investors the possibility to trade and write futures contracts directly on the TRON network. Each contract will be represented as an NFT, which gives more flexibility to the investors. Moreover, this feature will allow users to sell, auction, or giveaway their not-expired contracts.

## Problems
- lack of markets for expirable futures
- locking liquidity when buying a contract

## Solutions
- create a market for expirable futures contracts
- represent every contract as an NFT
- allow users to transfer, view and manage their contracts

## What it does
Miscanthus Finance is a decentralized market for expirable futures contracts. Users can either write or buy listed contracts. Each contract is represented as an NFT so it can be further transferred, auctioned, or even used in a giveaway. This feature might be handy for investors who locked their liquidity by buying a contract but now are in the urge to get it back. In that case, they can utilize contract flexibility and auction it before it expires. The project also has a feature to display and manage all active positions. From that dashboard, investors can settle, manage and cancel their assets.

## Basics of expirable futures contracts
Futures contracts are agreements to sell or buy an asset in the future for a specified price. Users can write and buy contracts for various reasons, where some of them are heading the risk or speculations. Futures

## How we built it
The project was built with UX and decentralization in mind. Since all logic is computed on-chain other contracts can utilize the composability of the project and use it in their smart contracts. Currently, all contracts are deployed to the Shasta testnet. After we will be satisfied with the code quality, we will be making a public release on the Mainnet.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Making a place for investors and speculators to write and trade futures contracts on Tron. Moreover fine-tuning Stationbids.com and letting users auction their not expired futures contracts. All of this will further improve Tron's DeFi ecosystem and will allow the to make more advanced protocols in the future.

## What's next for Miscanthus Finance
- Start with the market for expirable futures contracts
- Improve Station Bids to let users sell their positions represented as NFTs
- Collect and implement feedback received from the community
- Create markets for more derivative assets options, perpetual futures, straddle options, etc.
